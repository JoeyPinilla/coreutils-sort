	* src/sort.c: Added uintmax_t discrim member to struct line.
	* src/sort.c (line_discriminator): New function.  Returns discriminator
	given line and key.
	* src/sort.c (get_month): added function declaration above
	line_discriminator so line_discriminator can call it.
	* src/sort.c (keycompare): added call to line_discriminator
	* src/sort.c (struct md5_ctx random_md5_state): added declaration above
	line_discriminator so line_discriminator can call it.
