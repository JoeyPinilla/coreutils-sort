	* src/sort.c (line_discriminator): Fixed error with "/tests/misc/sort-compress".
	Program no longer dumps core due to an unallocated pointer being freed.

2011-1-31 Drew Kutilek <dkutilek@ucla.edu>
	* src/sort.c (human_numeric_discriminator): Fixed error with negative
	numbers.  Program now passes all -h tests in "/tests/misc/sort".  Program
	only fails -g options now.
	
2011-1-31 James Wendt <jwendt@cs.ucla.edu>
	* src/sort.c (general_numeric_discriminator): Now copies bytes from double
	to discrim instead of using pointers.
	* src/sort.c (line_discriminator): Changed byte shuffling to no longer
	apply to general_numeric keys.

2011-1-30 Drew Kutilek <dkutilek@ucla.edu>
	* src/sort.c (numeric_discriminator): Fixed error with $INTMAX_MAX and 
	$INTMAX_OFLOW.  Program now passes test "/tests/misc/sort-discrim".

2011-1-30 James Wendt <jwendt@cs.cula.edu>
	* src/sort.c (line_discriminator): Changed byte shuffling to apply to
	general_numeric keys.

2011-1-30 James Wendt <jwendt@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/sort.c (numeric_discriminator): Changed output type from char* to
	uintmax_t.
	* src/sort.c (human_numeric_discriminator): Changed output type from char*
	to uintmax_t.
	* src/sort.c (general_numeric_discriminator): Changed output type from
	char* to uintmax_t.
	* src/sort.c (line_discriminator): Changed byte shuffling to apply only to
	non-numeric keys.

2011-1-29 James Wendt <jwendt@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/sort.c (general_numeric_discriminator): New function. Returns
	discriminator for general numeric key.
	* src/sort.c (line_discriminator): Calls function to calculate
	discriminator according to key.

2011-1-28 James Wendt <jwendt@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/sort.c (struct line): Replaced keybeg and keylim pointers with a
	uintmax_t discriminator used for quick comparisons.
	* src/sort.c (fillbuf): Removed precomputation of position of first key
	since keybeg and keylim pointers are no longer in use.
	* src/sort.c (keycompare): Computes begining and limit of key since it is no
	longer precomputed in fillbuf.
	* src/sort.c (compare): Checks if difference between discriminators is
	non-zero, if so, return result, otherwise, function compares as before.
	* src/sort.c (check): Load discrim instead of keybeg and keylim.
	* src/sort.c (mergefps): Save discrim instead of keybeg and keylim.

2011-1-28 James Wendt <jwendt@cs.ucla.edu>

	* ChangeLog: Changed ordering of this ChangeLog to follow the GNU Coding
	Standards already in place. Newest updates are to be  appended to the
	beginning of this document.

2011-1-28 Drew Kutilek <dkutilek@ucla.edu>

	* src/sort.c (human_numeric_discriminator): New function. Returns
	discriminator for human numeric key
	* src/sort.c (numeric_discriminator): New function.  Returns discriminator
	for numeric key
	* src/sort.c (unit_order): moved global variable in order to reference it
	previous to the old point.
	* src/sort.c (find_unit_order): added declaration above
	numeric_discriminator so numeric_discriminator can call it.

2011-1-26  Drew Kutilek  <dkutilek@ucla.edu>

	* src/sort.c: Added uintmax_t discrim member to struct line.
	* src/sort.c (line_discriminator): New function.  Returns discriminator
	given line and key.
	* src/sort.c (get_month): added function declaration above
	line_discriminator so line_discriminator can call it.
	* src/sort.c (keycompare): added call to line_discriminator
	* src/sort.c (struct md5_ctx random_md5_state): added declaration above
	line_discriminator so line_discriminator can call it.
